### About the Experiment 
**System description**

D.C. motors are the most commonly used as actuators in electro-mechanical control systems or servomechanisms. Compared to actuators like 2-phase a.c. motor and stepper
motor, the d.c. motor has the advantage of higher torque and simpler driving circuit. However the presence of a commutator and a set of brushes with the problems of 
sparking make the d.c. motor somewhat less durable. This of course is not true for a present day well designed d.c. servomotor.
					
The study of the dynamic characteristics of the d.c. motor is important because the overall performance of the control system depends on it.
A standard analysis procedure is to model the various subsystems and then combine these to develop the model of the overall system.<br>
This experiment is designed to obtain the torque-speed characteristics, compute the various parameter and finally determine the transfer function of a d.c. motor.<br>
